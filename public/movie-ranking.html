<h1>Top Movies of All Time According to Opeyemi Salami</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Jumong</h3>
<p>This was my first koren movie. I can still remember me an my siblings running out in the middle of the night to go get the next episode of the movie; we were so in love with it</p>
<h3>Kingsmen</h3>
<p>I can watch this movie over and again without getting any tired. From the story, to the action, kingsmen was just a top tier movie</p>
<h3>Abejoye (The King maker)</h3>
<p>This is one of my best african movie, it shows african power at its best and also emphasises how the power of Jesus is greater than any other power</p>
